# Hi there ðŸ‘‹
This is Akib, an engineer and a researcher who is enthusiastic about
developping softwares 
on multiple layers
of the technology stack, from Operating System kernel to user layer.
My theme of development is gaining strong fundamental knowledge of the underlying software systems and
deploying that knowledge in a variety of tech-stacks.
Hence, my software development activity involves working on a variety of platforms and layers. 

- #### User Layer: Full-stack web development, Mobile (iOS/Android) application development
    - Web Stack: React.js, Django, AWS EC2, AWS S3, Nginx, PhP, MySQL, SQLite, MongoDB
    - Mobile Applicaiton Stack: RxSwift, Objective C, Networking libraries such as URLSession, Multi-threading with GrandCentralDispatch, RxJava, Android Service, AsyncTask
<!-- At the user layer, my expertise lies on: 
- Full-stack web development with React.js, Django, AWS EC2, AWS S3, Nginx, PhP, MySQL, SQLite, MongoDB 
- iOS development with RxSwift, Objective C, Networking libraries such as URLSession, Multi-threading with GrandCentralDispatch 
- Android development with RxJava, Android Service, AsyncTask -->
- #### Middleware Layer: UNIX (Linux/Mac) library development, iOS frameworks and Android library development
    - UNIX stack: C/C++, Python3, Docker, Vagrant, Shell Script 
    - Mobile Applicaiton Library stack: Bluetooth libraries such as iOS Corebluetooth and Android Bluetooth Module, Logging libraries such as CocoaLumberJackLogger and Log4j
- #### Kernel Layer: Kernel feature development, Network protocol stack and firmware analysis
    - Tech Stack: Networking subsystem of Linux, Broadcom Wifi/Bluetooth combo firmware, RPC on embedded linux OS
<!-- My expertise at the kernel level includes:
- Developping Remote Procedure Call (RPC) feature on Tizen (An embedded linux OS) with C/C++
- Developing Firewall by developing a linux kernel module that connects into Netfilter hooks
- Security analysis of networking compoments of kernel such as TCP/IP protocol stack, Wifi/Bluetooth firmware -->
